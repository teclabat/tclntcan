# rsvisa.test --
#
#	Tests for the rsvisa extension.
#
# Note: These tests are basic smoke tests that verify the package loads
# and commands are available. Full testing would require actual VISA hardware.

package require tcltest
namespace import ::tcltest::*

# Load the rsvisa package
test load-package-1.0 {Load ntcan package} -body {
    package require ntcan
} -result {1.0.0}

# Note: Full integration tests would require actual VISA hardware
# connected to the system. The above tests verify that:
# 1. The package loads correctly
# 2. All commands are registered
# 3. Argument validation works properly
