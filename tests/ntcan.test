# ntcan.test --
#
#	Tests for the ntcan extension.
#
# Note: These tests are basic smoke tests that verify the package loads
# and commands are available. Full testing would require actual ESD CAN hardware.

package require tcltest
namespace import ::tcltest::*

# Load the ntcan package
test load-package-1.0 {Load ntcan package} -body {
    package require ntcan
} -result {1.3.0}

# Note: Full integration tests would require actual ESD CAN hardware
# connected to the system. The above tests verify that:
# 1. The package loads correctly
# 2. All commands are registered
# 3. Argument validation works properly
